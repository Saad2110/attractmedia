<h3>In today’s digital age, no matter what business you have, your website is your brand’s identity. It is the first thing potential customers see when looking for information about your product or service. Every digital marketing effort around your business points directly to your website.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Want to know a shocking fact? It takes&nbsp;less than 3 seconds&nbsp;for users to decide whether they like your website or not. Because user attention span is very short, you have to ensure that the first impression they get is good.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<h3>Not convinced? Here’s another stat.&nbsp;88% of your website visitors&nbsp;won’t come back after having a poor experience with your website. So the bell rang? Great because now we are on the same page.</h3>

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Let’s find out the key reasons you should consider a website redesign asap. Let’s dive right in.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong>What is Website Redesign?</strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Website redesign is a process of improving the design and user experience of an existing website to make it more user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to navigate. A typical website redesign process includes a complete revamp of the website’s front-end design, user interface, and user experience.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Aside from these factors, a website redesign is necessary if you want to change the website’s core structure, functionality, or content. Now let’s move on to the common reasons you should now.</h3>

<h1><strong><mark>10 Compelling Reasons Why You Should Redesign Your Design</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Sometimes we don’t understand why we are not getting leads, sales, or conversions from our website even though we are getting traffic. The main reason is that your website design looks old and outdated.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>You have to face the fact that the Internet is very competitive, and if you want to stay ahead of the game, you need to have a modern, responsive design, and user-friendly site. Here are some reasons why you should consider a website redesign:</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Improve User Experience</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>When it comes to improve your website’s conversion rate, you must focus on improving the user experience. A poor user experience will drive users away from your website and your competitors.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A good user experience, on the other hand, will keep users engaged with your website and make them more likely to convert into customers. 88% of online consumers are less likely to return to a site after a bad experience.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>If your website’s UX is poor, you’re likely losing many potential customers. So website redesign will definitely help you.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><mark><strong>Better Security</strong></mark></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>As time goes on, new security threats arise, and new ways to protect against those threats are developed. And one more thing is customers buy from more secure sites. If your website is not up-to-date with the latest security standards, it’s at risk of being hacked.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>However, the design of your website is not the only factor determining its security. The way you host your website and the type of CMS you use also play a role in determining how secure your website is.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Improved Search Engine Optimization</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Search engine algorithms are constantly changing and evolving. To keep your website ranking high in search results, you must ensure that it’s optimized for the latest algorithms. A website redesign is often a best way to improve your search engine rankings. It is also a great opportunity to update your content and add new pages. It can help you improve your website’s ranking for long-tail keywords and get more organic traffic.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Outdated CMS</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Regarding the content management system of your website, it’s important to stay up-to-date. If you’re using an outdated CMS, your website will likely miss out on many features and security updates. With that, there is a possible chance that you might get hacked. There are a lot of content management systems available in the market but no can beat WordPress.org.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Rebranding</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A complete website redesign is necessary if you’re planning on rebranding your business. Your website is one of your brand’s most important touchpoints and needs to reflect your new brand identity. It is a great opportunity to update your website’s design, content, and messaging to reflect your new brand.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Add Custom Functionality to your Site</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Every CMS comes with default built-in conversion tools. But some do not have all the features you might want or need for your website. You might need to add custom functionality to your website to achieve your goals. But the thing is you can’t do it because of the way your website is currently built.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>For example, in Shopify CMS you cannot edit the sitemap of your eCommerce store and have to use a third-party app like Hacked Shopify sitemap. If you want to add custom functionality to your website, you need to redesign it using a CMS that allows for customization.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Industry-Specific Design Trends Changed</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>It is something new that most business owners don’t know. Because of the fast-paced nature of the design industry, design trends are constantly changing. And if you want your website to look up-to-date, you need to make sure it’s using the latest design trends. Redesign your website again is a great opportunity to take advantage.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><mark><strong>Your Competitor’s Website Makes You Jealous</strong></mark></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>Who does not love a good look? If you visit your competitor’s website and it looks much better than yours, it might be time for a website redesign. A good-looking website can help you win over customers and make a great first impression. If your website makes you jealous, it’s time for a change.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><mark><strong>Increase Indexing Rate</strong></mark></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>From 2021 to now, Google is changing a lot. Google is now indexing websites in a mobile-first manner. It means that if your website is not optimized for mobile devices, then it’s likely not being indexed by Google. With this in mind, it is very difficult for your website to rank in Google’s search results. Creating your website with customer preferences in mind can help you get more leads and sales.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>You Don’t Like Your Website Anymore</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>As human nature, we change our tastes with time. The same goes for websites. Because your website is an extension of your brand, it’s important that you like it. Why would customers be if you’re no longer proud of your website? If you’re unhappy with your website, it might be time for a change.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":1} -->
<h1><strong><mark>Keep Your Website Up To Date With a Website Redesign</mark></strong></h1>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>As you can see, the 10 reasons why it’s important to keep your website up to date with a redesign. Your website is your online calling card and first impression for many potential and ideal customers. It needs to look professional, modern, and accessible on all devices. If you’re not keeping up with the latest design trends, your website will look dated very quickly.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {""level"":3} -->
<h3>A website redesign is a chance to give your site a fresh look, incorporate new features, and ensure that it’s responsive and mobile-friendly. It’s also an opportunity to improve your SEO and fix any technical issues that may have arisen since your last update. Don’t wait too long to redesign your site – an outdated website can do more harm than good. Invest in a website redesign today and keep your business looking its best online.</h3>

<p>BREAKING NEWS!  Ryan Yeti just released a brand new fancy video on his YouTube channel!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s his channel here: <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanYeti?sub_confirmation=1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">RYAN YETI – Marketing &amp; Investing</a></strong> </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watch the video but here’s his script for reference: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“Did you know that the average person encounters up to 10,000 ads every… day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about that… ten thousand ads… every… single… day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now say you’re responsible for a business with a marketing budget… How are you going to invest those marketing dollars to actually stand out from all that noise and get people to notice you above everyone else?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>THAT is a great question and this is our bread and butter so let’s talk about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “Let’s dooooo this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Super Short Intro</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey guys, I’m Ryan Yeti and THANK YOU so much for clicking this video and hanging out with me for a while.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m an award-winning marketer, designer and entrepreneur who’s sold millions running marketing agencies since 2006.  I’ve had a crazy ride of high’s and lows but through it all, I believe I’ve learned some things that can help other people find success.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All I ask is that you click that like button now so this video get’s out to more people who may need some help.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay so you have a marketing budget and you want to break through the noise?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First things first, if you haven’t already, be sure to check out my previous video on Inbound Marketing.  I believe it’s super important to invest in getting that area dialed in first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s your marketing foundation so make sure you get that set up right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But once you have that, you’re going to want to find additional ways that your business can stand out and get noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That brings us to Annual Marketing Campaigns.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point #1: Pick One Time Every Year To Invest A Large Portion Of Your Marketing Budget</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, instead of spreading out your marketing dollars throughout the entire year, it’s best to hit it hard with one big strategic marketing campaign!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That way you’re basically everywhere for 2 weeks to a month and you really drill yourself into your prospects psyche.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you do this annually and you do it well, people will come to expect and even look forward to your marketing campaigns each year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This can work wonders if one of your main goals is “Top of mind” branding.  Meaning, if you want people to think of your business when they need your product or service.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We have many clients, but to properly illustrate marketing campaigns, I’m going to use this video to tell you about work we’ve done for one of my favorite clients, Cherry Insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cherry has been an amazing client of ours since 2013 and we’ve been fortunate to do some cutting-edge projects over the years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They’re located in a beautiful small city in Canada called Saskatoon. When local residents list off Insurance companies, many of them will have Cherry as one of their most recognized local insurance companies.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How did we do that? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, every year for the month of June, we always invest in a super creative, big marketing campaign for Cherry Insurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over years of experimentation, I think we’ve really hit on something that works marvelously.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve found a way to get people to spend hours on an insurance website for the entire month of June.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And not only spend hours on the Cherry website, but also they get tons of other people to share Cherry’s website with their friends and family, who, in turn, spend even more hours on Cherry’s website.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But what is this wonderful marketing strategy that we’ve been using with Cherry?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “It’s a secret, don’t tell em”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No secrets.  Think about this, what do people love more than anything both on the Internet and in real life?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cute pets of course!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, a study surveyed 2,000 pet owners and found that 34 per cent of parents value their their pets more than their own children, saying that their pets are their ‘favourite child. ‘</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>(https://midogguide.com/maintenance-and-care/why-do-people-love-their-dogs-more-than-their-children.html)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So a few years back, we created something called Cherry’s Annual Cutest Pet Contest!  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The response has been incredible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We host a voting contest on Cherryinsurance.ca where people can post their cutest pet photo and share it with all their friends and family while encouraging them to come back every day to vote once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Contestants can only vote once per day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the end of the month, the owner whose pet has the most upvotes, wins a big cash prize and plenty of other prizes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People go crazy.  For a relatively small city, the first place finisher can have up to 25,000 votes in one month… when people can only vote 1 time, per day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This causes Cherry’s website statistics in June to go crazy and it has worked wonders for their business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But it’s not just hosting a contest that got Cherry these results.  It’s also their courage to invest in super creative, attention-grabbing advertisements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point #2:  Invest In Super Creative Advertisements</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>David, what’s that thing we always say about the best marketing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “The best marketing, doesn’t feel like marketing”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People see 10,000 ads every day.  If your strategy is to have the most cliche ad with a ton of text, it’s not going to be successful and you’re likely better off just saving your money.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “But what if I own a business that’s boring?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those are actually the best businesses to advertise!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If your business is in a boring industry, that can be one of the best things you have going for you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Think about it, all the most boring industries that are difficult to differentiate, have the best marketing.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Insurance has Geico… who uses a talking lizard mascot named Martin. And people remember Geico ads… because they stand out from the noise.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or think about Coca-Cola… they sell sugar water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coca-Cola has used some incredible advertising strategies over the years, including using animated Polar bears to sell their products on Christmas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In fact, did you know that Coca-Cola advertisements are responsible for defining who Santa Clause is?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s true, before 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Yellow Clause, to Skinny Clause, to Scary Claus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “AHHHHHH”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned an artist Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those exact paintings helped establish Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called “A Visit from St. Nicholas” —commonly known now as “Twas the Night Before Christmas.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>See, creative marketing can have a massive impact.  You’ll stand out, get noticed and maybe even change the world as we know it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if it was only to sell more sugar water…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Point #3:  Dare To Be Different</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can have the best media buying mind on the planet… you can be the best data person with the best manual bidding strategies and the best audience research strategies and the most dialed in and optimized sales funnel…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if your brand, your product, your service, your message, your story does not grab attention, does not engage people, doesn’t speak to people, doesn’t separate itself from it’s competition…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It doesn’t matter.  Nothing else really matters anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you haven’t seen it, you have to check out one of my favorite ads ever.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s the Think Different campaign that Steve Jobs used for triumphant return in 1997.  I definitely recommend watching it. I’ll link it below in the video description.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But the message is so true. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The people crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.  They “Think Different” and that’s what you’ll need to do to get noticed on the world stage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But saying that… it’s not easy.  It takes a lot of courage and conviction to stand out and continuously put yourself out there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “You gotta have balls, grit, the gusto!  Out with the old and IN with the bold I say!”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At my marketing agency, Attract, we love doing bold things to stand out from the noise.  We even chose an extreme color palette of pink for that very reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I even have a talking statue head in my videos… being different is key haha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&gt;&gt;David “Hey!?”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since we’re talking about Cherry in this video, we’ve done some crazy billboards we’ve done for them over the years.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For instance, dressing up a mannequin and mounting it on a billboard is always a fun way to get a lot of attention.  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve put them in house coats, construction gear, papered over them, and even used extensions and shadows to stand out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We even designed the back of a bus as the front of the bus with the Cherry characters.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve done some fun stuff for Cherry with video as well.</p>

<p>From raising over 200 thousand with a couple Cherry Christmas campaigns to just last year we wrote and performed an animated song to help people feel better during all the crazy stuff we all went through the past couple years.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We even may have inspired a Family guy episode with one of our Cherry Insurance ads.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll link both these videos in the video description as well.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A simple framework for creating magical marketing campaigns that will help you stand out, get noticed and even get results.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead of just spreading out your campaign dollars throughout the year, consider investing a considerable chuck at the same time, every year to accelerate the impact of your marketing budget.<br />Be as creative as possible, so that you’re not just annoying people.  Remember, the best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing!<br />Work up the courage to do it.  Remember, the doors of success will only open to those bold enough to knock.</p>

<p>Hello! We’re <strong><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/portfolio/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Attract Media</a></strong> and it’s very nice to meet you!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is one of our first blogs so I think a little introduction is in order.  We’re a brand spanking new marketing agency from Canada with big, creative ambitions and loads of business/marketing savvy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m <strong><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Kaitlyn</a></strong>. A professional graphic designer, animator &amp; illustrator. I also assist with the social media marketing aspect of what we do at <strong>Attract</strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I work alongside my partner <strong><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Ryan Yeti</a></strong> (Yedersberger) who started a marketing agency called Stealth in university and grew it to make millions (If you live in Saskatchewan you might have seen the playful Cherry Insurance Billboards with mannequins hanging off, or the Cutest Pet contest that we host every spring/summer for Cherry). Ryan sold Stealth in 2018 and agreed to work there for a few years after.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, 2020 was a turbulent year for everyone and with it coming to an end, so many things in our lives have changed. With all the ups and downs, and general funk of the past year, Ryan and I wanted to create something we could be excited about. And after working from home together so often due to the pandemic, and seeing how well we work together, we got inspired to start a new business where we could put our talents together by becoming a designer/marketer duo extraordinaire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We wanted to create a different kind of marketing agency that helps businesses grow through <strong>(1) brave creative marketing techniques</strong> that get attention &amp; <strong>(2) promote the idea of inbound (attract) marketing</strong>. Essentially promoting the idea of having people come to you instead of always going to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So we set our sights on designing a website, creating social media pages, and registering our name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And voilà, our dreams are reality! The name of our agency became <strong><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Attract Media</a></strong>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Coming from the age-old adage that <strong>when you focus your energy on growth, gratitude, and giving value to others, good things will be attracted back to you</strong>. Tony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, and Alan Watts (to name a few) all teach this phenomenon, and why wouldn’t it apply to businesses as well? We want to veer away from the corporate, robotic lingo and templated designs, and instead, <strong>help create brands that have heart that feel genuine</strong>. We want to create ads that are entertaining instead of annoying. And we ultimately want to be the positive and uplifting side of the marketing game.</p>

647,"11 Crazy Web Design Statistics You Won’t Believe!","Web design industry is always changing and evolving, so it can be tough to keep up with the latest trends. As of August 2022, there are 5.03 billion people around the world who use the internet today – equivalent to 63.1 percent of the world’s total population. Statista says that number will only grow in the coming years, reaching an estimated 5.78 billion by 2025.

Now the thing is, how are you going to make your website stand out from the rest? How can you ensure that your website is relevant and engaging for your target audience? Today I’m going to share 11 essential web design statistics that will help you understand the current trends and how you can use them to your advantage in 2022.

Before we start, It’s important to understand that web design trends are always changing. What was popular last year may not be so popular this year. And what’s popular this year may not be popular next year. So it’s important to keep up with the latest design industry stats if you want your website to stay relevant.

<strong>1. 75% of Website Credibility Comes from Web Design</strong>
When someone visits your website, they’ll first notice the design. And whether the user realizes it or not, the design will play a big role in their opinion of your website. With that in mind, ensuring your website has a good design is important. A well-designed website will help you build trust with your visitors and make them more likely to do business with you.

<strong>2. 74% of Users Are More Likely to Return to Mobile-Friendly Sites</strong>
A website with a good mobile experience is more likely to be visited again by users. It’s no secret that more and more people are using their smartphones to browse the internet. According to Google, 70% of Internet users spend their time on mobile devices. So it’s important to ensure your website is mobile-friendly to keep your visitors returning. Or you are going to lose a big part of your audience.

<strong>3. 73% of Companies Invest in Design to Help Their Brand Stand Out from Competitors</strong>
Everyone wants their business to stand out from the competition. And one way to do that is with a good design. A well-designed website will help you attract attention and make a positive impression on potential customers. A good design is also a great way to show that you’re an innovative and forward-thinking company.

<strong>4. Slow-Loading Websites Lead to a $2.6 Billion Revenue Loss Each Year</strong>
A poor website design can have a major impact on your site and one of them is slow loading time. Online consumers will likely leave if your website is slow to load before they even get a chance to see what you offer. Also, website speed is a ranking factor in Google search so that a slow website can hurt your page ranking.

<strong>5. Users Spend 88% More Time on Pages with Videos</strong>
If you are running an eCommerce store, you should include product videos on your product pages. Because it play vital role. Studies have shown that users spend 88% more time on pages with videos than on pages without videos. And if you’re selling products, you want potential customers to spend as much time as possible on your product pages. Product videos are a great way to engage potential customers and help them learn more about your products.

<strong>6. 92% of Consumers Read Online Reviews and Testimonials</strong>
When buying a service or product, most people will do their research online before making a purchase. And one of the best ways to get information about a service or product is through reviews and testimonials. It’s important to ensure your website has plenty of positive reviews and testimonials from satisfied customers.

<strong>7. There Are Currently Over 2 Billion Active Websites</strong>
The number of websites online is constantly increasing. And that number will only continue to grow in the years to come. We mostly know popular sites because of their branding, Saskatoon web design, and Saskatoon marketing. But, as the number of sites continues to increase, it’s becoming more and more difficult for businesses to stand out from the crowd. A good design will help you attract attention and make a positive impression on potential customers. So what’s stopping you from getting started on your new design?

<strong>8. Investment in UX Design Can Have Up to 9,900% ROI</strong>
It’s 2022, and everything is about user experience. Because if users don’t have a good experience on your website, they’re not going to stay. And if they’re not staying, that means they’re not buying, which is why investing in UX design is important. Adding visual elements, action button, easy to use navigation bar will help you keep visitors on your site and make them more likely to convert into customers.

<strong>9. WordPress Accounts for 42.2% of All Websites</strong>
WordPress.org is the most popular content management system and powerful tool in the world. And it’s not surprising why. WordPress is easy to use, has many features, and is affordable. WordPress is a great option if you’re looking for a content management system for your website.

<strong>10. Because of the Increase in Mobile Traffic, Amp Pages Are Becoming More Popular</strong>
AMP pages are designed to load quickly on mobile devices. And with the increase in mobile traffic, AMP pages are becoming more and more popular. If you want your website to load quickly on mobile devices, you should consider using AMP pages.

<strong>11. 94% of First Impressions Are Related to Your Website’s Design</strong>
Your website’s design is the first thing potential customers will see. And you only have a few seconds to make a good impression. A customer will likely make a split-second decision about whether they will stay on your site. So it’s important to make sure your design is professional and engaging. The good news is that you can always hire a professional web designer to help create a great-looking website.

<strong>Wrapping it up</strong>
So that was a brief overview of some of the latest web design trends for 2022. As you can see, investing in a good design is important if you want your website to stand out from the competition. If you’re unsure where to start, hiring a professional web designer is a great option.

<strong>FAQ’s</strong>
<strong>Why Is Web Design So Important?</strong>
Web design is important because it can help you make a good impression on prospective customers. Studies have shown that web design can play a role in influencing people’s buying decisions. A well-designed website will make it easy for visitors to find the information they need and be visually appealing so that people will want to stay on the site.

<strong>Why Is Website Loading Speed Important?</strong>
A website’s loading speed is important because it directly affects visitors’ experience. Visitors will likely get frustrated and go elsewhere if a site takes too long to load. In addition, sites that load quickly will typically receive more traffic and conversion rate. Search engines also take loading speed into account when ranking websites.

<strong>How to See Statistics of Website?</strong>
There are different tools for every metric, like Google Analytics, Google Search Console (GSC), and Ahrefs. Each tool measures something unique, so it’s important to use the right tool for the job.

Google Analytics is great for understanding website traffic, including bounce rates of your website, where visitors are coming from and what pages they’re visiting. GSC is great for understanding how your website performs from a technical standpoint, including page load times and errors. And Ahrefs is great for understanding backlinks, including who’s linking to your website and how authoritative those links are.

You gotta figure out <br />1) what you’re doing right… <br />2) what you’re doing wrong… <br />and 3) what you’re not doing yet.</p><p>What’s that phrase we always say?</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: “You need to be in the places where people look for what you sell”.</p><p>Right. So say you’re selling insurance… What is the FIRST thing prospects do when they realize… “Hey… you know, I think I might NEED some insurance?”</p><p>They go online and search for it of course.</p><p>These days, for businesses doing it right, the Internet is essentially a giant sales funnel that’s constantly streaming in new potential customers.</p><p>And this is what we want for you and your business.</p><p>If you’re not getting clients yet from the Internet, it means your funnel is broken and we need to fix it.</p><p>Let’s first look at your Reviews &amp; search engines rankings.</p><p>For this example, we’re going to pretend we’re an insurance company but this can apply to almost any industry or business.</p><p>Do this… go over to a search engine and type the word Insurance, then the city you’re in.</p><p>I’m in Canada so for example, I’m going to type in “Toronto Insurance”</p><p>Alright, there’s 3 things to look for on this page. 1. Google ads 2. Local listings and 3. SEO.</p><p>Google Ads are those listings at the top that Google tries to disguise as the actual search results. They used to be pretty easy to spot but now the only way you can tell is that little bold “AD” beside each of them.</p><p>Google Ads are CPC or Cost per Click meaning that you only pay if customers click these links. These can be great advertising investments if you set them up right, however, it can be complex so I’d recommend reaching out to a marketing pro for help with this.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David “Or figure it out yourselves, you look smart enough!”</p><p>Next let’s look at the listings beside the map. These are called Google Local Listings. When you first set up your business address on Google Maps, you may remember using a service called “Google My Business”. Well that information is displayed here.</p><p>For this section, you’re going to wanna make sure you have quality pictures of your work, a great description and make sure you fill out everything you can with lots of links back to your website.</p><p>You can then promote or optimize your business listing to be one of these top 3 listings. This is a fantastic way to get new clients.</p><p>Next, see how each of these listings show star reviews right underneath them?</p><p>These reviews are some of the most important marketing tools you have. 93% of customers will make buying decisions based on reviews, so it’s imperative that you put some focus on these and get a ton of 5 star reviews.</p><p>(Source: <a href=""https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/"">https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/online-review-stats/</a>)</p><p>But how do you do that? Well, obviously provide an amazing service with tremendous value to clients and ask them to leave you a review.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David “But what if they were an a$$hole?”</p><p>Well, and that’s the problem, upset/angry clients tend to be eager to leave bad reviews and happy clients tend to forget to leave 5 star reviews. So another thing you can do is send clients review gateway emails.</p><p>What are review gateway emails? Well, after you finish work with a client, you can use this service to send out an email or text message asking them to leave you a 5 star review with 2 options...</p><p>Either YES, you’ll leave a Google review where the service directs them immediately to Google to leave that 5 star review or..</p><p>NO and the service will direct them to a feedback page where there’s an apology message and they can leave you an angry message on how you can improve.</p><p>This is great because you can set this up to automatically be sent to your customers after using your service to get tons of 5 star reviews and you don’t risk accidentally getting bad reviews from upset clients.</p><p>Make sense?</p><p>&gt;&gt;David “So we send happy clients to rate us on Google and the a-holes to a website form?”</p><p>Pretty much</p><p>&gt;&gt;David “Niiiice””</p><p>Okay, next, is something called Search Engine Optimization or SEO. This refers to the ranking of these top rankings. You can actually pay a marketing agency to have you rank in the #1 spot of these searches. Be careful though, there are a million companies that say they can do SEO but only a few that are any good.</p><p>But, if they do it right and you end up ranking in the #1 position for this, it can be one of the best ways to consistently obtain new clients.</p><p>However, say you’re ranking really high already for SEO and already have great reviews on Google.</p><p>Next, we have to see what’s going on with</p><p>your Logo, Website &amp; Video</p><p>Now, you can have the highest ranking website in search engines and the best reviews but if people click on your website and find that your website &amp; logo are outdated, slow or looks bad, you’re not going to convert them into clients.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: How’s your logo? Does it look like your nephew made it in Microsoft Paint?</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: How’s your website? Is it lookin’ like it belongs in MySpace in 2004?</p><p>If you answered YES to either of those questions, definitely invest in improving both of these. They are part of your marketing foundation and some of the most important marketing tools you have as a business today.</p><p>But remember, just because you have a pretty website &amp; logo, it doesn’t mean that they will get you new clients. The person or agency that makes it should have knowledge &amp; experience in conversion… meaning that if 100 people visit your website, how many actually convert into clients?</p><p>For example, the top section of your website is extremely important. Some people call it the hero section or the section “above the fold”.</p><p>“Above the fold” gets its name from newspapers. Remember those? A few of you may remember buying newspapers waaay back in the day. They’d be stacked and folded with all the most important headlines and images appearing “above the fold”.</p><p>The same is true with your website. You’ll want to put your most attention grabbing headline &amp; images in the top section of your website.</p><p>But what if you want to take things ever further?</p><p>Well, let me ask you this… what do you think is the second biggest search engine in the world? You know the leading search engine is Google so second you'd probably think Bing or Yahoo or something.</p><p>Nope, believe it or not, it's actually YouTube. YouTube is the second most used search engine in the world and more than ever people are watching and listening to information instead of reading it.</p><p>That’s why I believe one of the most important marketing tools available today (other than your website) is a video that sells.</p><p>Why? Well if you have a great video that pitches your business in the best and most concise way possible you can use that video everywhere. On social media, in paid ads and even as a play button on your website to help increase your conversion rate.!</p><p>Alright, so now you have an incredible brand, website &amp; video that converts customers like crazy and you appear high in search engines with great SEO and you have a tone of 5 star reviews.</p><p>Often, THIS is enough to consistently bring in tonnes of new customers all on their own.</p><p>However, if you want even MORE customers. There are additional things you can do.</p><p>Now let’s talk about Outbound Marketing…</p><p>The social media marketing &amp; online advertising landscape has been changing rapidly every single year.</p><p>To expand your marketing net, there are 3 effective ways to do it.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: If you’re not lazy, you can start putting out content yourself.</p><p>Do you have valuable knowledge or skill sets that can help others? If so, that’s great! Start consistently making videos on that topic.</p><p>Depending on your target demographic, you’ll likely find that you’ll get the most organic reach on TikTok, Instagram Reels and YouTube.</p><p>However, Snapchat and even Pinterest videos are performing well recently so definitely check those out as well.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: You can pay a marketing agency to consistently make social posts for you.</p><p>As a business owner, it’s extremely difficult to run your business while growing your audience online. That’s why many businesses often choose to hire a marketing agency to do it for them.</p><p>That way, if a potential client is looking at your business online, they’ll be able to see that you keep your social media up to date with current posts and these posts will consistently be presenting your business to potential customers throughout the year.</p><p>&gt;&gt;David: You can take the video we talked about earlier and promote it!</p><p>Believe it or not, paid video ads can still work if you do them right. Especially now that you made sure your attraction marketing game is set up right.</p><p>With video, you can promote it all over online. You can hire a marketing agency to do this for you or you can do it yourself!</p><p>We’ve found some of our best return on investments on Facebook, TikTok and Pinterest of all places. But we’re always experimenting and trying new things!</p><p>So that’s it!</p><p>You have appear in the first spot in search engines (with SEO)<br />You have a tone of 5 star reviews<br />You have a gorgeous new logo <br />You have a website that converts clients for your 24/7!<br />You have a quality video that you can use on both your website or social media<br />You have fresh, up to date, social media channels<br />You can invest in paid ads whenever you like to smooth out slow periods.</p><p>This is the perfect balance of outbound and inbound (attraction marketing).</p><p>For most businesses, this is an excellent marketing game plan that should get you results.</p><p>However, if you want even MORE clients, I’d recommend looking into trying out an annual marketing campaign where you invest your marketing dollars in one big push every year.</p><p>This way you can break through the noise and stand out from all your competition.

Are you tired of your business being invisible in a sea of competitors? Are you struggling to come up with new and exciting marketing ideas to get your business noticed in 2023? Well, fear not my friend, because I have the solution for you!

First off, let's talk about the elephant in the room: social media. I know, I know, you're probably thinking ""not another social media article,"" but hear me out. Social media is constantly evolving and in 2023, it's going to be all about the ""Super Stories."" These are interactive stories that allow customers to engage with your brand in a whole new way. Think polls, quizzes, and even shoppable links.

But why stop at just one platform? Take your social media game to the next level by creating a multi-platform campaign. You can use Instagram for visual content, Twitter for real-time updates, and TikTok for fun, short-form videos. And don't forget about newer platforms like Clubhouse and Instagram Reels, they could be a game changer.

Next up, let's talk about Influencer Marketing. Yes, it's been around for a while, but in 2023, it's going to be all about micro-influencers. These are everyday people with a small but dedicated following, who are often more relatable and authentic than traditional influencers. Plus, they're typically less expensive to work with. So, find a micro-influencer in your industry and let them spread the word about your business.

But why stop at just one influencer? Take it to the next level by creating a squad of micro-influencers. They'll work together to create a buzz about your brand and reach a larger audience. Plus, it'll give you a chance to see which influencer resonates best with your target audience.

Now, let's talk about an oldie but a goodie: email marketing. It's a tried and true method, but in 2023, it's all about the ""personal touch."" Use email marketing to send personalized messages to your customers based on their interests and buying behavior. And don't be afraid to get creative with it! Try incorporating interactive elements like polls and quizzes to keep things interesting.

And last but not least, let's talk about the ultimate marketing idea of 2023: Augmented Reality (AR). AR is a technology that overlays digital information on the real world. It's going to be huge in 2023 and it's a perfect way to get your business noticed. You can use AR to create an interactive experience for customers, whether it's a virtual try-on feature for clothes or an interactive scavenger hunt to find your products.

In conclusion, there are many new and exciting marketing ideas to get your business noticed in 2023. From Super Stories on social media to micro-influencer squad, personalized email marketing, and augmented reality experiences, you have many options to choose from. Don't be afraid to think outside the box and have fun with it! Because after all, in the world of marketing, the only thing that's dead is boring.

<h3><strong>Video Script:</strong></h3>
""Did you know that the average person encounters up to 10,000 ads every… day.

Think about that… ten thousand ads… every… single… day.

Now say you’re responsible for a business with a marketing budget… How are you going to invest those marketing dollars to actually stand out from all that noise and get people to notice you above everyone else?

THAT is a great question and this is our bread and butter so let’s talk about it.

&gt;&gt;David “Let’s dooooo this.

Super Short Intro

Hey guys, I’m Ryan Yeti and THANK YOU so much for clicking this video and hanging out with me for a while.

I’m an award-winning marketer, designer and entrepreneur who’s sold millions running marketing agencies since 2006.  I’ve had a crazy ride of high’s and lows but through it all, I believe I’ve learned some things that can help other people find success.

All I ask is that you click that like button now so this video get’s out to more people who may need some help.

Okay so you have a marketing budget and you want to break through the noise?

First things first, if you haven’t already, be sure to check out my previous video on Inbound Marketing.  I believe it’s super important to invest in getting that area dialed in first.

That’s your marketing foundation so make sure you get that set up right.

But once you have that, you’re going to want to find additional ways that your business can stand out and get noticed.

That brings us to Annual Marketing Campaigns.

Point #1: Pick One Time Every Year To Invest A Large Portion Of Your Marketing Budget

Sometimes, instead of spreading out your marketing dollars throughout the entire year, it’s best to hit it hard with one big strategic marketing campaign!

That way you’re basically everywhere for 2 weeks to a month and you really drill yourself into your prospects psyche.

If you do this annually and you do it well, people will come to expect and even look forward to your marketing campaigns each year.

This can work wonders if one of your main goals is “Top of mind” branding.  Meaning, if you want people to think of your business when they need your product or service.

We have many clients, but to properly illustrate marketing campaigns, I’m going to use this video to tell you about work we’ve done for one of my favorite clients, Cherry Insurance.

Cherry has been an amazing client of ours since 2013 and we’ve been fortunate to do some cutting-edge projects over the years.

They’re located in a beautiful small city in Canada called Saskatoon. When local residents list off Insurance companies, many of them will have Cherry as one of their most recognized local insurance companies.

How did we do that?

Well, every year for the month of June, we always invest in a super creative, big marketing campaign for Cherry Insurance.

Over years of experimentation, I think we’ve really hit on something that works marvelously.

We’ve found a way to get people to spend hours on an insurance website for the entire month of June.

And not only spend hours on the Cherry website, but also they get tons of other people to share Cherry’s website with their friends and family, who, in turn, spend even more hours on Cherry’s website.

But what is this wonderful marketing strategy that we’ve been using with Cherry?

&gt;&gt;David “It’s a secret, don’t tell em”

No secrets.  Think about this, what do people love more than anything both on the Internet and in real life?

Cute pets of course!

In fact, a study surveyed 2,000 pet owners and found that 34 per cent of parents value their their pets more than their own children, saying that their pets are their ‘favourite child. ‘

(https://midogguide.com/maintenance-and-care/why-do-people-love-their-dogs-more-than-their-children.html)

So a few years back, we created something called Cherry’s Annual Cutest Pet Contest!

The response has been incredible.

We host a voting contest on Cherryinsurance.ca where people can post their cutest pet photo and share it with all their friends and family while encouraging them to come back every day to vote once.

Contestants can only vote once per day.

At the end of the month, the owner whose pet has the most upvotes, wins a big cash prize and plenty of other prizes.

People go crazy.  For a relatively small city, the first place finisher can have up to 25,000 votes in one month… when people can only vote 1 time, per day.

This causes Cherry’s website statistics in June to go crazy and it has worked wonders for their business.

But it’s not just hosting a contest that got Cherry these results.  It’s also their courage to invest in super creative, attention-grabbing advertisements.

Point #2:  Invest In Super Creative Advertisements

David, what’s that thing we always say about the best marketing?

&gt;&gt;David “The best marketing, doesn’t feel like marketing”

That’s right.

People see 10,000 ads every day.  If your strategy is to have the most cliche ad with a ton of text, it’s not going to be successful and you’re likely better off just saving your money.

&gt;&gt;David “But what if I own a business that’s boring?”

Those are actually the best businesses to advertise!

If your business is in a boring industry, that can be one of the best things you have going for you!

Think about it, all the most boring industries that are difficult to differentiate, have the best marketing.

Insurance has Geico… who uses a talking lizard mascot named Martin. And people remember Geico ads… because they stand out from the noise.

Or think about Coca-Cola… they sell sugar water.

Coca-Cola has used some incredible advertising strategies over the years, including using animated Polar bears to sell their products on Christmas.

In fact, did you know that Coca-Cola advertisements are responsible for defining who Santa Clause is?

It’s true, before 1931, there were many different depictions of Santa Claus around the world.

From Yellow Clause, to Skinny Clause, to Scary Claus.

&gt;&gt;David “AHHHHHH”

But in 1931, Coca-Cola commissioned an artist Haddon Sundblom to paint Santa for Christmas advertisements.

Those exact paintings helped establish Santa as a warm, happy character with human features, including rosy cheeks, a white beard, twinkling eyes and laughter lines.

Sundblom drew inspiration from an 1822 poem by Clement Clark Moore called “A Visit from St. Nicholas” —commonly known now as “Twas the Night Before Christmas.”

See, creative marketing can have a massive impact.  You’ll stand out, get noticed and maybe even change the world as we know it.

Even if it was only to sell more sugar water…

Point #3:  Dare To Be Different

You can have the best media buying mind on the planet… you can be the best data person with the best manual bidding strategies and the best audience research strategies and the most dialed in and optimized sales funnel…

But if your brand, your product, your service, your message, your story does not grab attention, does not engage people, doesn’t speak to people, doesn’t separate itself from it’s competition…

It doesn’t matter.  Nothing else really matters anymore.

If you haven’t seen it, you have to check out one of my favorite ads ever.

It’s the Think Different campaign that Steve Jobs used for triumphant return in 1997.  I definitely recommend watching it. I’ll link it below in the video description.

But the message is so true.

The people crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.  They “Think Different” and that’s what you’ll need to do to get noticed on the world stage.

But saying that… it’s not easy.  It takes a lot of courage and conviction to stand out and continuously put yourself out there.

&gt;&gt;David “You gotta have balls, grit, the gusto!  Out with the old and IN with the bold I say!”

At my marketing agency, Attract, we love doing bold things to stand out from the noise.  We even chose an extreme color palette of pink for that very reason.

I even have a talking statue head in my videos… being different is key haha.

&gt;&gt;David “Hey!?”

Since we’re talking about Cherry in this video, we’ve done some crazy billboards we’ve done for them over the years.

For instance, dressing up a mannequin and mounting it on a billboard is always a fun way to get a lot of attention.

We’ve put them in house coats, construction gear, papered over them, and even used extensions and shadows to stand out.

We even designed the back of a bus as the front of the bus with the Cherry characters.

We’ve done some fun stuff for Cherry with video as well.

From raising over 200 thousand with a couple Cherry Christmas campaigns to just last year we wrote and performed an animated song to help people feel better during all the crazy stuff we all went through the past couple years.

We even may have inspired a Family guy episode with one of our Cherry Insurance ads.

I’ll link both these videos in the video description as well.

Have you ever had a crazy idea for an advertisement?

Let us know in the comments!  If it’s great, we may even make it a reality and send you a little something.

So there you have it.

A simple framework for creating magical marketing campaigns that will help you stand out, get noticed and even get results.

Instead of just spreading out your campaign dollars throughout the year, consider investing a considerable chuck at the same time, every year to accelerate the impact of your marketing budget.
Be as creative as possible, so that you’re not just annoying people.  Remember, the best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing!
Work up the courage to do it.  Remember, the doors of success will only open to those bold enough to knock.

&gt;&gt; David: I can tell by looking at you that you have the go-nads and gusto to do it. If you got something useful from this video, make sure you hit like and subscribe.

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most important things is ensuring your content is easy to find and accessible to your audience. It does not matter how great your content is if no one can see it. That's why it's essential to have an effective web design.</p>

<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This means using clear, concise menus, well-designed navigation (drop-down menu), and search bar functionality. It also means ensuring your website works well on all devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones. By making your content accessible, you'll ensure that more people will see it and be able to engage with it.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Because the ultimate goal of a website is to increase conversion rate or to get people to take action, whether signing up for your newsletter, downloading a white paper, or making a purchase.</p>

And if your content is difficult to read, people will simply move on to something else. Because the audience has a short attention span, you need to ensure your content is easy to read and digest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This means using short paragraphs, clear headlines, and simple language. You also want to break up the text and make your content visually appealing. Making your content easy to read will keep people engaged and more likely to take action.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Designing for readability also means using typography that is easy on the eyes. This means choosing fonts that are legible and easy to read, as well as using proper spacing and indentation. By paying attention to the details of your web design, you can create a website that is visually appealing and easy to read.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you heard the quote, ""<strong>Don't Judge a Book by its Cover""</strong>. But in the digital world cover is everything because the first thing people see when they visit your website is the design. And if your design is not up to par, people will simply move on to something else and your bounce rate will be high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Users will judge your website by its appearance, so it's essential to ensure your design is professional and polished. This means using high-quality visuals, well-designed layouts, and consistent branding. By creating a website that looks great, you'll give people a positive first impression of your business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And while visuals are essential, you don't want to overload your website with images and videos. Too much visual content can make your website look cluttered and confusing, which might hurt your ranking in search engine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Instead, use visuals sparingly and only when they add value to your content. By striking the right balance, you can create a visually appealing website that provides a positive user experience.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Web design is more than just creating a website and pieces of content. It's about creating an online experience that is engaging for the visitors. And if your website is not attractive, people will simply move on to something else because they have more options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To create an engaging website, you need to consider the user experience. This means ensuring your website is easy to navigate, informative, and visually appealing. You also want to make sure your website loads quickly and is mobile-friendly. By paying attention to the user experience, you can create a website that people will actually want to use.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->
<p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And when people enjoy using your website are more likely to stay on your site longer and engage with your content. This can lead to more leads and conversions for your business. So, suppose you're not paying attention to web design. In that case, you're missing out on a valuable opportunity to engage with your audience.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} -->

15423,"Is Marketing Dead? Or More Important Than Ever? (2023)","<p><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} --></p>
<h1><strong>Marketing: the process of promoting a product or service, and building relationships with customers. </strong></h1>
<p>The question on many people's minds is, is it really necessary in today's digital age? Has it become obsolete, like the fax machine or the VCR?</p>
<p>Well, let's think about it. Imagine a world without marketing. A world where businesses just create products and hope that people will stumble upon them and decide to buy them. It would be chaos! A world without marketing would be like a grocery store without signs or labels. You would have no idea what anything was or where to find it. The milk would be next to the toothpaste, and the cereal would be in the freezer.</p>
<p>Marketing is the glue that holds everything together. It's the reason you know that the milk is in the dairy section and the cereal is on the cereal aisle. Without marketing, businesses would have no way of telling customers about their products or services, and customers would have no way of finding what they're looking for.</p>
<p>But, you may say, ""Isn't the internet supposed to make marketing obsolete? Can't I just find anything I need online?"" Well, let's consider that for a moment. Sure, the internet has made it easier for people to find information about products and services. But it's also made it easier for businesses to create and share their own marketing messages. The internet has given rise to a whole new set of marketing tools and channels, like social media, search engine optimization, and email marketing, that businesses can use to reach and engage customers.</p>
<p>In fact, the internet has made marketing more important than ever. The world is more connected than ever, and the competition is fierce. Businesses need to find ways to stand out and grab customers' attention. Marketing is what helps them do that.</p>
<p>But the internet isn't the only reason marketing is more important than ever. The world is changing. People's attitudes and behaviors are changing. Businesses need to stay on top of these changes and adapt their marketing strategies accordingly.</p>
<p>For example, consumers are becoming more environmentally conscious. They want to buy products that are sustainable and ethically made. Businesses need to find ways to communicate their commitment to sustainability to attract these customers. Marketing is what helps them do that.</p>
<p>And let's not forget the importance of digital transformation. In the past, we have seen that the businesses that have failed to adapt to digital trends didn't survive the shift. Businesses must adapt to the changing digital landscape, create effective digital marketing strategies to remain ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>In short, marketing is not dead. It's more important than ever. It's what helps businesses stand out in an increasingly competitive and constantly changing world. So, let's all raise a glass to the unsung hero of the business world: marketing!</p>
<p>Of course, if you still don't believe me, that's okay. You can continue living in a world without marketing. But be warned: you may have to brush up on your cow-milk-finding skills.</p>

<h1>Today, I want to talk about something that's been on my mind lately - Ai and its impact on the marketing world.</h1>
<p>Picture this: You're scrolling through your social media feed and you come across a personalized advertisement for a pair of shoes that you were just browsing on an e-commerce website. You can almost hear the AI technology behind the scenes saying, ""Hey, Ryan! I see you were checking out those shoes. Want to take a closer look?"" This is the future of marketing, my friends.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of generic, mass-appeal advertisements. With AI, brands can now gather data on their customers, track their behavior, and create targeted campaigns that cater to each individual. It's like having a personal shopper, but for your entire online shopping experience.</p>
<p>AI is also changing the way that marketing campaigns are executed. No more manual labor for marketers. With AI, tasks such as email campaigns and social media posts can be automated, freeing up time for marketers to focus on the creative and engaging content that really matters. And with natural language processing and computer vision, AI can even help brands identify and respond to trends in real-time. It's like having a marketing sidekick, always ready to jump into action.</p>
<p>I mean, look at these incredible images I generated with Ai in just minutes.</p>

<p>This has allowed us to take our web design and illustration game to the next level in so many ways.</p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the data. AI allows brands to collect and analyze massive amounts of data in real-time, giving them valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. This information can then be used to improve the customer experience and build trust between brands and consumers. It's like having a secret weapon, always armed with the latest intelligence.</p>
<p>Another perk of AI in marketing is its ability to measure the effectiveness of campaigns. With advanced analytics, brands can track the results of their campaigns in real-time and make adjustments on-the-fly. This data-driven approach to marketing helps reduce the risk of failure and increases the chances of success. It's like having a scorecard, always keeping track of your progress.</p>
<p>And finally, AI is changing the way that marketing is perceived by consumers. Personalized advertisements and a more seamless shopping experience make marketing less intrusive and more enjoyable for consumers. With AI, brands can offer tailored experiences that speak directly to the interests and needs of each individual. It's like having a friend, always there to help and make your life easier.</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks. AI is changing the marketing landscape for the better, and I couldn't be more excited about it. Personalized experiences, automation, data-driven decision making, and a shift from mass appeal to individualized attention. It's like a dream come true for marketers and consumers alike.</p>
<p>In conclusion, AI is transforming the way that we interact with brands, and it's here to stay. So, let's embrace the future and see what amazing things AI has in store for us next. And while you're at it, hire our award-winning marketing agency to revolutionize your brand and marketing strategy with AI.</p>

16385,"How To Choose The Right Web Design & Marketing Agency In 2023","<h1><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/saskatoon-web-design/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">If you're here, it's because you're trying to up your web design and marketing game in 2023.</a></h1>		
		<p><!-- wp:paragraph {""fontSize"":""medium""} --></p>
<p>Well, you've come to the right place. As a marketer, who's been on the front lines of marketing since 2006, I've learned a thing or two about hiring the best companies to make your brand shine online. So, let's dive in and talk about what you need to know to hire the best web design and marketing company for your company.</p>
<p>First things first, let's talk about why you need a <strong><a href=""https://attractmedia.ca/saskatoon-web-design/"">web design and marketing company</a></strong> in the first place.</p>
<p>In today's digital age, <strong>your online presence can make or break your business</strong>. Your website is often the first impression that potential customers have of your brand, and your marketing strategy is what will keep them engaged and coming back for more. That's why it's crucial to hire a company that can create a killer website and develop an effective marketing plan that will help you stand out from the competition.</p>
<p>But how do you choose the right web design and marketing company? Here are a few tips to get you started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do your research:</strong> The first step in finding the right web design and marketing company is to do your research. Look for companies with a strong portfolio of work that aligns with your brand's style and goals. Read reviews and testimonials from other clients to get a sense of their experience working with the company.</li>
<li><strong>Look for an agency with an experienced team:</strong> The success of your website and marketing strategy will depend on the team working on it. Look for a company with a talented team of designers, developers, and marketers who can bring your vision to life. Make sure they have experience working on projects similar to yours and are up-to-date on the latest web design and marketing trends.</li>
<li><strong>Ask about their process:</strong> Every web design and marketing company will have a different process for working with clients. Make sure you understand their process and how they will keep you informed throughout the project. Ask about timelines, milestones, and how they handle revisions and changes.</li>
<li><strong>Check their pricing:</strong> Of course, you'll want to make sure the company you choose fits within your budget. However, DO NOT make price the main deciding factor. Look for a company that offers value for money and can deliver the results you need. As with anything, you'll find you get what you pay for.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've found a web design and marketing company that meets all of these criteria, it's time to get started. But before you do, here are a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>Be clear about your goals:</strong> The more specific you can be about your goals, the better. Make sure the company understands your target audience, your brand's style, and the results you want to achieve. This will help them create a website and marketing strategy that truly aligns with your needs.</p>
<p><strong>Stay involved:</strong> While the web design and marketing company will handle the bulk of the work, it's important to stay involved throughout the process. This will help ensure that the final product truly reflects your brand and goals.</p>
<p><strong>Be patient:</strong> Creating a killer website and effective marketing strategy takes time. Don't expect overnight results. Instead, trust the process and be patient as the company works to create something truly amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Be willing to make changes:</strong> While you should be clear about your goals, be open to suggestions and changes from the web design and marketing company. They are the experts in their field and may have insights and ideas that you haven't considered. Being open to their suggestions can lead to even better results than you initially imagined.</p>
<p><strong>Measure your results:</strong> Once your website and marketing strategy are in place, make sure you are tracking your results. Use tools like Google Analytics to measure website traffic, engagement, and conversions.

		We wanted to created a deep story brand, linked to the family’s name and history, thus “The Cherry Family” was born. The brand was to be playful and funny, utilizing bright cherry-toned colors, and goofy characters getting into troublesome antics. “Expect the Unexpected” became their well-known tagline, as well as the annual “Cutest Pet Contest” hosted in the summertime. Combined, their marketing creates warm and fuzzy feelings in the viewers, and their annual campaigns keep them at top-of-mind when folks are considering insurance companies.
